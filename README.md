# kadane-s-algo-python
this is a simple pytjon code with O(n) time complexity .. 

the kadanes algorithm works like this:
1) to get the maximun sum of subarray we should have two variables one that will hold the current total and another one for maximun sum till now . and remeber just make current sum to be zero as it will get < 0 because if the next iteration will be positive then it will be highest with just itself
